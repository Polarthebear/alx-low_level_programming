## 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries


Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries or DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries), are compiled binary files containing code and data that can be loaded into a program's memory space at runtime. Unlike static libraries, which are linked directly into the executable during compilation, dynamic libraries are linked dynamically when the program is executed. Multiple programs can share and use the same dynamic library, allowing for more efficient use of system resources and enabling updates to the library without recompiling the entire application. Dynamic libraries promote modularity and code reuse in software development.

- 0: A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life - Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed
- 1: Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future - create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
